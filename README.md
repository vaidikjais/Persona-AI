## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
- `npm` or a similar package manager

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-persona-chat.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-persona-chat.git)
    cd ai-persona-chat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    - Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    - Add your secret Google AI API key to this file. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    ```
    # .env.local
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
    ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  **Push your code to GitHub.**
2.  **Import your project on Vercel.** Sign in to Vercel with your GitHub account and import the repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: In your Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Environment Variables" section and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (the same one from your `.env.local` file). This is a crucial step to ensure your server-side API key is used securely in production.

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application, providing you with a live URL.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

This project implements a dual API key system to ensure both security and flexibility:

- **Server-Side Key (Default)**: The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` stored in `.env.local` (and in Vercel's environment variables) is only ever accessed by the server-side API route (`/api/chat`). It is never exposed to the client, making it secure.
- **Client-Side Key (User's Option)**: When a user enters their own API key in the settings modal, it is saved exclusively in their browser's `localStorage`. All API calls made with this key are sent directly from the user's browser to the AI provider, bypassing our server entirely. This ensures the user's private key remains private to them.
